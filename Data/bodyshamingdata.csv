Today going to be posting about a topic which is extremely sensitive to something i often talk about but i feel high time i is about BODY though everything around us has evolved and there is so much advacement in science and technology but sad to see that something as mere as our mindset Even though so many people talk about loving yourself and feeling comfortable in your own how many of us actually truely feel that Everyone has some insecurities or something about themselves or their outer appearance like to Although i am a positive i myself struggle with this because we are surrounded by negative and small minded people who always People around us feel that it is absolutely ok to throw their opinion but they fail to realise how it affects our mental When someone comments about your figure or keeps passing hideous jokes about your it does nothing but makes the other person feel concious and they begin to realise how worthless they are which in turn leads to Some of are extreme fitness freaks which is absolutely great because you have made a choice to lead a healthy lifestyle but it mean that there are other people out there who are lazy or Some people have other issues for their sudden or persistent weight it could be due to a health condition or hormonal problem and not because they sit all day on the couch and be lazy or eat junk food high time we respect that and stop judging people based on outer It determine our all of us will perish someday and outer beauty last What i value the most is inner and how we can help others in the smallesy way No one which achieve greatness in life by stepping over someone or putting others down to make themselves feel So lets start being Be humble and be grateful for what you have and most of love yourself for who you Positivity begins from within and we all have a purpose in Know YOU are YOU are And YOU are ,1
